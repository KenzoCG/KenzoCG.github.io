<h2>Welcome to the KenzoCG Docs</h2>
<p>
    These pages serve as a companion to my YouTube videos, courses, and projects.
    My primary focus is on 3D applications, automation, mathematics, and quirky coding projects.
    I'd be honored to have you here, as I believe that sharing knowledge and ideas strengthens the community.

<p>Please note that this site is still a work in progress and is not meant to be a comprehensive manual for any specific topic.</p>
