<h2>Editors</h2>
<p>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code (VS Code)</a> is one of the easiest and most popular choices for Python development today.
    It offers many free extensions that enhance Python support within the editor.
    Another option (but more as a side companion) is <a target="_blank" href="https://jupyter.org">Jupyter Notebooks</a>.
    Jupyter Notebooks is a web-based interface for Python that allows running code in isolated blocks rather than executing an entire script.
    All said though, you will most likely want to use VS Code for writing your software and maybe Jupyter Notebooks for testing blocks of code.
</p>
<p>
    For VS Code you will also want to make sure you install the python extensions.
    If you have not installed python yet, I would recommend doing that first so the extensions can auto-detect python for you.
</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python">Python extensions for VS Code</a></p>
<p>You can also press <code class="highlight">Ctrl + Shift + X</code> while in VS Code to open the extensions tab and then search for the extension ID.</p>
<code class="highlight">ms-python.python</code>
<p>The extension will also install two other extensions for you automatically.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Pylance - to provide performant Python language support</li>
    <li>Python Debugger - to provide a seamless debug experience with debugpy</li>
</ul>

<h2>Python Distributions</h2>
<p>
    Some applications embed a Python interpreter within their source code (such as Blender), meaning you may not need to install Python separately on your machine.
    However, it's still a good idea to install Python separately, as your code editor will likely require it for IntelliSense and debugging.

    Follow the guides below for your operating system if you need further assistance.
    <b>Note</b> the important thing to do is, make sure when you run the python installer that you check the box to enable system paths.
    Enabeling system paths will let your operating system find python when you type the command <code class="highlight">python</code> into the terminal.

<p>
    After installing the python interpreter, you can check if you operating system can find the path.
    Open the terminal and type <code class="highlight">python</code>, then press enter to see if the interpreter starts.
    Also be sure to close any terminals you had open during installation as they will not be updated.

<h2>Windows Help</h2>
<p>If your operating system cannot find python, follow these steps to add python to your system variables.</p>
<p>Go to you start menu and search for <code class="highlight">edit system variables</code> and open the application.</p>

<p>Next, follow the menus as shown.</p>

<p>
    If you dont see both of the paths in box 4, click on new and navigate to your python installation directory.
    <b>Note</b> python normally installs into <code class="highlight">C:\Users\_YOUR_USER_NAME_\AppData\Local\Programs\</code>.
</p>
<p>Here are the two directories needed, just make sure the python version matches the version you installed.</p>
<ul>
    <li><code class="highlight">C:\Users\_YOUR_USER_NAME_\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\Scripts</code></li>
    <li><code class="highlight">C:\Users\_YOUR_USER_NAME_\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\</code></li>
</ul>
